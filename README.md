The first commit has the initial versions of bitwise_and.py, second_lowest.py and exception.py.

Modified bitwise_and.py to fix the code timeout issue with the previous version. The previous version was inefficient
as it looped through all possible combinations of a and b to find valid values of (a & b < k) and then evaluated
the maximum of the running list to add to the results list. It passed the basic test cases as they involved small
numbers. It failed to scle up to the complete test cases due to its limitations.
